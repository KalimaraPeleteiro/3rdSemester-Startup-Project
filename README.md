# 3rdSemester-Startup-Project

A Project for college in which a fictional startup was developed.
The idea for "AgroConnect" was to create a plataform upon which users would create requests based on their demands, with
agricultural producers responding these requests.

The website was developed using Flask, besides HTML, CSS and JS files.
